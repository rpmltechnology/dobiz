                              The first ROC Annual Compliance of the company is to submit directors' KYC to ROC (mca.gov.in), with the prescribed form DIR-3(KYC), if a director is filing KYC for MCA for the first time. The director who has filed KYC during the previous year can file via a web-based portal at the MCA Portal. Anyone who was issued a Director's Identification Number (IDN) before 31 March 2021 must file KYC. This is due by 30 September 2021. <br />
             
                              The DIN KYC must be filed on time. There is no fee. But, if the due dates are missed, the DIN is deactivated. A ROC fee (Rs.) may be charged to activate a deactivated DIN. 5000/-. We urge all promoters to file the DIN KYC as soon as possible to avoid the late penalty.

A company's financial statements need to be audited before the AGM. The statutory auditor must be in full-time practice and appointed as a company auditor. Section 139 of the Companies Act (2013) stipulates that the auditor must be an independent individual and not be providing accounting or consultancy services to the company. An independent panel of qualified and experienced chartered accounting professionals is available as your company's statutory auditor. The auditor is required to give their opinion on whether the financial statement reflects an accurate and fair view of the business.
