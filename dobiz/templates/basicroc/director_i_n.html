                        <p class="fs-6">Director's KYC Filing, an annual task, applies to any person who was allocated a DIN (Director Identity Number) before 31 March 2022. DIR-3 KYC forms must be filed to the ROC to maintain the records of the ROC with the correct Address, phone number and email address of directors/designated associates. It is mandatory to file the form within the deadline of October 2022. If filed before that date, there is no charge from the government. Failure to file KYC within the due date will result in the deactivation of DIN numbers. This can be done by filing DIR-3 KYC and late filing fees at Rs. 5000 for each defaulting Director or designated partner. </p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4">Fill in the Director KYC Form for the FY 2021-22 Now.</h2>

A company/LLP must ensure that the DIR-3KYC is completed with the ROC and filed for each person given a DIN number. We offer discounts of up 40% to COVID-19-affected business owners. </p>
                        <h2 class="fs-4">The procedure of First-Time Filing Director KYC Filling 2022 </h2>
                        <p class="fst-italic">If the Director is filing DIN KYC in the first instance, they need to attach a filled copy of MCA Prescribed DIR-3. A mandatory attachment to the form is the copy address proof. The form DIR-3 is signed with a digital signature by the applicant director. This is followed by attesting a CA/CS or CMA in full-time practice. The DIR-3 KYC filing process is as follows. </p>

The web-based filing doesn't require you to upload or submit any document. The Director must ensure that the Director's information is accurate and not changed.</p>
