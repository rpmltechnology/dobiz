Therefore, a manager or business owner should know the meaning of a Trademark and its types. It is likely that you already know that trademarks are distinctive mark or symbol that represents an organization and separates it from other firms.</p>
                      <p class="b-style text-style">Every company has IPR assets that can be considered trademarks, such as the Name Your Business, Brand Name Label Logo, Product Name and Punchline, and Domain Names. We've observed that the majority of the trademarks used by an organization remain unidentified because of ignorance; they can cause the possibility of litigation and dispute in the future. We highly recommend our clients know the significance of a trademark and take the appropriate steps to protect the same.</p>

                      <p>We've understood the meaning of Trademark in the preceding sections. Let's now look at the various Trademark categories trademarked by the Trademarks Act 1999. From a practical perspective, when filing a trademark application on the TM-A (Earlier, the name was TM-1), The prescribed form to submit a trademark registration in India, the applicant needs to select the type of Trademark, and this may be selected from the following choices. The following is an example only of the following important types of Trademark.</p>
                      <h2 class="fs-4 pt-4">"Word" in the sense of Trademark</h2>
                      <p class="b-style text-style">A word or other groups of letters/alphabets is the most well-known kind of mark. Examples include Apple, GOOGLE, INFOSYS, TATA, IBM, .etc. The Word Mark as a Trademark is a most valuable and important one. Word work can be drawn, written and even spoken. Because of its more comprehensive range is thought to be the most potent Trademark for IPR Protection under the Trademark Act 1999.</p>
                      <p class="b-style text-style">If you have a Trademark registered as an e-wordmark, you can apply it to any format on the marketplace. If a person else is using the same or similar mark, that owner's wordmark could quickly initiate an action of infringement. It is important to note that the wordmark does not need to be a word, as any word or combination can be valid enough if it's distinctive.</p>

There is increasing interest in adopting colors or mixing them to create trademarks in the marketplace. It is, however, the most challenging trademark category to secure legally and legally enforced. The world trade organization has expanded its legal meaning of Trademark to include "any sign...capable of separating the products or services of one company from those of other businesses.</p>

The shape of the container could be another type of intellectual property, such as design. The Trademark is used to identify the source of the product, and the design protection will refer to the fundamental characteristics of the design. If, however, the design has become distinctive due to its use in many different ways, it can be registered as a trademark. An excellent example of how this works is with the Coca-Cola Bottle.</p>
