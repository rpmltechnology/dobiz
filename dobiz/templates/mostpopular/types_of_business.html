            <h4> Business Structure to begin your own business in India </h4>
            <p> Companies in India are classified into different types according to various aspects, such as the
              necessity to register, the process to register, the amount of capital investment, and the responsibility
              of the business owners. Entrepreneurs in India can choose the structure they prefer to establish their
              businesses among various choices available. They include private companies, public corporations,
              one-person businesses, section 8 partnerships, proprietorship companies, LLPs, trusts, societies, and
              others. </p>

            <p class="b-style text-style">The list of proposed activities plays a significant role in deciding which
              type is the most suitable to begin a business in India. For instance, companies involved in social welfare
              activities have different goals for selling goods or services to earn profits. Thus, they need to be
              registered under different categories. The following table lists the most appropriate kinds of businesses
              based on the type of business they are engaged in. </p>

                <p>It is recommended to consider the potential risk or liability and then decide on the best type that
                  we will be able to begin the business in India. A small-sized retail store has a low risk of
                  responsibility compared to businesses involved in international trade or dealing with dangerous
                  chemicals. From the viewpoint of Risk and Liability, business structure can be divided into two
                  classes. First, there is a situation where the owner's liability is limited to the amount to which it
                  is subscribed. The category is where the owner's liability is inimitable.</p>

                <p class="b-style text-style">The concept of limited liability for entities where the business and their
                  owners are regarded as distinct legal entities, the owners, have protection from the liability and
                  losses that the company faces. The liability of owners in a limited liability company is limited to
                  the share capital they have subscribed to. The table below categorizes businesses according to the

                <p>Businesses, such as proprietorships and Partnership Companies, have no separation between management
                  and ownership. The sole proprietor of a proprietorship is accountable for its management and control.
                  In contrast, each partner of a partnership company, or as stipulated by the Partnership Deed, handles
                  the control and management of the company. But, some structures, such as companies or LLPs, can
                  distinguish between management and ownership. The table below categorizes each business based on the
                  distinction between management and ownership. It is possible to consider the company's management as a
                  factor that can be used for starting a business in India.</p>

                      identical in all business types. But, there are some variations in the total cost, mainly due to
                      taxes due to the annual submission of tax returns to the ROC. The table below outlines the
                      application of annual filing for various business structures in India. You may choose to start a

          <p> The Basic Documents of the Promoters (Directors or Shareholders) and Proof of the Registered Office are
            required to begin the process. The first thing that we do is to make the make the Digital Signature (DSC) of
            promoters as the application for incorporation of the company is filed electronically and signed with the

          <p> As discussed earlier, the new company name must be new and unique, complying with the guideline issued for
            name approval of the company. Ideally few names in order of preference should be filed in Spice Plus form at
            the time of Private Limited Company Registration online. However, to be doubly sure about the name
            availability, an advance application may be filed with the ROC in the prescribed RUN form only to obtain the
            Name Approval. Making a separate application in RUN is advisable when the promoters intend for a specific
            name for the company, however, it involves additional cost. </p>

      that it exists beyond the lives of its promoters. In case the company has to be closed for any reason, we have to
      first ascertain whether the company is an “Active Company” or an “Inactive/Defunct Company”. The approach to
      closing the company shall vary based on the above determination. Following is the brief method of closing a
