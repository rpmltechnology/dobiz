          <h2>GST and Income Tax</h2>
        <p><b>Financial transactions are regular in any business. Recording them in chronological sequence (as it occurs) is called accounting. With a solid and thoughtful accounting system, compliance with tax regulations is always a simple procedure. Every business is required under law to collect tax from the final consumer of the products or services offered. GST is a tax that must be collected. Tax is required to be imposed at the appropriate rate. The GST must be paid before the due date with the government, and its periodic return must be submitted. Similar obligations exist in the income tax. Tax for the business. You must experience hands to handle tax obligations; otherwise, you could be required to pay penalties and interest for the time the tax obligation has expired. Our CAs, who are certified, are always available to assist you.GST &amp; TAX

        <h2>Income Tax Return Filing</h2>
        <p>According to Income Tax law, TDS must be taken out at the appropriate rate when making a payment to a third party. Not deducting TDS causes the disqualification of expenses, thereby increasing the ultimate income tax liability of the company. We manage everything related to TDS.</p>
        <h2>GST Registration</h2>
         <p class="b-style text-style">Any person who offers products or services is required to be registered under GST. Non-registered taxpayers will not be able to take GST payments or claim tax credits for input (ITC) for purchases made in the country of origin. GST Council has set a limit of 20 Lakhs of turnover as the threshold to be registered under GST.</p>
        <h2>GST Return and Compliance</h2>
        <p class="fst-italic">The new indirect tax system was designed on the principle of a seamless flow of GST Credit throughout the supply chain. Taxpayers must complete a monthly calculation of GST and return. But, for smaller taxpayerâ€™s tax payers, the GST return must be filed quarterly. </p>
