                      <p class="fs-6 pt-2">There is a policy that the AD Banker must approve the establishment of a
                        branch office. Cases will be forwarded to the RBI for approval if the automatic route is
                        impossible. After a quick verification, approval can take up to a week.</p>

                      <h2 class="py-2">Registering a branch office with the ROC</h2>
                      <p class="fs-6 pt-2"> The RBI approves the establishment of branch offices in India. Within 30
                        days, the FC-1 application is submitted for registration. If there are Indian directors, the DIN
                        Number of such directors is required. Additionally, the digital signature and authorization of
                        the authorized signatory are required to file the ROC's statutory forms.</p>
                      <p class="fs-6 pt-2"> PAN Card, Bank A/c Open </p>
                      <p class="fs-6 pt-2"> Income Tax Department issues a unique 10 Digit Alphanumeric number to each
                        taxpayer as a permanent number. This is also known as the PAN number. Every taxpayer must have a
                        Tax Deduction Number to comply with TDS requirements. These identification numbers are vital for
                        compliance with tax rules. After the Income Tax Department has allotted Pan Number, the branch
                        account can be opened. </p>
